1. Write a program
   Given an array, rearrange such that all odd numbers come at the start of array in ascending order followed by all even numbers in descending order.
   
   Example:
   Input : arr[] = {12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 37, 23}
   Output : arr[] = {5, 23, 37, 52, 12, 10, 6}

def rearrange_odd_even(arr):
    odd = [x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0]
    even = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]

    odd.sort()
    even.sort(reverse=True)

    return odd + even
   
   
2. Write a program which lists out all possible sequence of 5 digit binary numbers. Read from the the list and then check whether they are divisible by 4 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 4 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

Example:
Sequence of 3 digit numbers are 
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111

Numbers divisible by 4 are
100

binary_number_5_digit=[]
for i in range (10000,11112):
    binary_number=''
    for j in str(i):
        if j=='0' or j=='1':
            binary_number=binary_number+j
    if len(binary_number) == 5:     
        binary_number_5_digit.append(binary_number) 
length=len(binary_number_5_digit) 
for i in range(length):
    num=[]
    for j in binary_number_5_digit[i]:
        num.append(j)
    num[0]='0'
    num=''.join(num)
    binary_number_5_digit.append(num)
print(binary_number_5_digit)  

binary_num_div_4=[]
for i in binary_number_5_digit:
    if int(i)>0:
        if int(i)%4==0:
             binary_num_div_4.append(i)
        
print(binary_num_div_4)


3. Write a program Given the year, find number of 5th Saturday's in that year.

import datetime

year = int(input('Enter year: '))
start_date = datetime.datetime(year, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime.datetime(year, 12, 31)
sat_in_year=[]
while start_date <= end_date:
    if start_date.weekday() == 5:
        sat_in_year.append(start_date)
    start_date += datetime.timedelta(days=1)
fifth_sat_in_year=[] 
for i in range(1,13):
    count=0
    for j  in  sat_in_year:
        mon=j.month
        if mon==i:
             count=count+1
    if count==5:
        fifth_sat_in_year.append(j)
            
print(len(fifth_sat_in_year)) 
   
4. Given a list of numbers, write a  program to create a list of tuples having second element as the number and first element as the cube of the number.

Input: list1 = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1), (8, 2), (27, 3)]


result=[]
for i in list1:
	v=(i**3,i)
	result.append(v)
	

   
5. Write a program to interchange 1st and 3rd row of a 3x3 matrix.

Input : 3x3 Matrix
Output : 3x3 Matrix with 1st and 3rd row interchanged.

def interchange(mat, n, m):
    rows = n
    for i in range(n):
        t = mat[0][i]
        mat[0][i] = mat[rows-1][i]
        mat[rows-1][i] = t

mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
n= 3
m = 3
interchange(mat, n, m)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        print(mat[i][j], end=" ")
    print()	

6. Write a program to read a text file of size not more than 1kb. Search for all the words in that file that contain letters 'i' and 'u' and replace those words with same word capitalized.

import os

file_path = "/path/to/your/file.txt"
file_size_bytes = os.path.getsize(file_path)
file_size_kb = file_size_bytes / 1024

if file_size_kb <= 1:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        words = data.split()
	transformed_words = [word.replace('i', 'I').replace('u', 'U') for word in words]
        sentence = ' '.join(transformed_words)

    print(sentence)
else:
    print("File size exceeds 1 KB.")
