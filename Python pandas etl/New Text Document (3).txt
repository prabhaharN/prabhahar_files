What does this star schemas are used for?

	What kind of data we are dealing here?

	How many star schemas you see in this model?

	Which fact table will have more records and why?

	If I have one policy where customer pays 20 premiums over 20 months, policy started on 1-JAN-2024

	How many records you will have in policy premium expected fact ? How many records you will have in policty premium paid fact?

	Write a query to show the expected premium amount for an agent 'UMA' this month

	Write a query to know agentwise, customerwise, policy count. Consider only records which has more than 5 policies

	What is the premium we received in the last month

	Want to see month_name, excepted policy amount, actual received amount for each month in the current year

	Want to see the policies from where we missed the payment for last month? What is your logic. Write the query for the same

	what is the purpose of period table you see in the system?



we connect dimensional table and fact table based on this star schema

	polices data

	2 star schema

	20  records in expected fact and 6 records in paid fact

	select amount from expect_fact where agent='UMA' and  extract( month  from date)=6 and extract( year  from date)=2024

	select agent_name, customer_name,count(policy) from expected_fact group by agent_name, customer_name having count(policy)>5

	select sum(amount) from paid_fact where to_char( date, 'mm-yyyy')like '05-2024'

	select to_char(e.date, 'mmmm') , sum(e.amount) , sum( p.amount) from expected_fact e left join paid_fact p on e.date=p.date and e.customer_name= p.customer_name and e.agent_name= p.agent_name where extract(year from date)= 2024 group by to_char(e.date, 'mmmm')
