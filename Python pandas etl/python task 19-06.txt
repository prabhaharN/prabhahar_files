Write a Python program to print "Hello, Python!" to the console.

print('Hello, Python!')

User Input and Output:

Create a program that takes the user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting.

name=input('enter name : ')
print('hello, ',name)


Arithmetic Operations:

Write a Python script to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers entered by the user.

num1=int(input('enter number 1: '))
num2=int(input('enter number 2: '))
addition = num1+num2
print(f'addition of {num1},{num2} is {addition})
subtraction = num1+num2
print(f'addition of {num1},{num2} is {subtraction}') 
multiplication = num1+num2
print(f'addition of {num1},{num2} is {multiplication}')
division = num1+num2
print(f'addition of {num1},{num2} is {division}')

Conditional Statements:

Implement a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.
num=int(input('enter number: '))	
if num%2==0:
	print('even')
else:
	print('odd')

Loops:

Write a Python program to print the multiplication table (up to 10) for a given number.

num=int(input('enter number: '))
for i in range(1,11):
	 print(i,'x',num,'=',i*num)

Lists and Iteration:

Create a list of fruits and use a loop to print each fruit on a new line.
fruit=['mango','apple','banana']
for i in fruit:
	print(i)



Functions:

Define a function that calculates the square of a number and then use it to calculate the square of 5.
def calculate(num):
    c = num ** 2
    return c

num = 5
calculate(num)



String Manipulation:

Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the input in uppercase.

st = input('Enter a string')

print(f'{st.upper()}')

Lists and Sorting:

Create a list of numbers and sort them in ascending order.

l = [5,3,2,57,85,4,9,5,1,10]
l.sort()
l


File Handling:

Write a program to read a text file and print its content to the console.


def read_and_print_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            file_content = file.read()
            print(file_content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"Error: An IOError occurred. Details: {e}")

filename = 'num.txt'  
read_and_print_file(filename)
