	I have an dept table .In that dept table I have columns like deptno with primary key and dname with unique key. After that I insert vaue like this (insert into dept values(10,’’); insert into dept values(20,’’);), Does it allows null values second time ? 	 	no we can't insert same but it allows null value.
