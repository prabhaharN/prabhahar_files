1) Find the top 2 months of sales in the year 2023

SELECT * FROM
(dense_rnk() over(partition by total_cost order by yyyy) d_rnk
FROM sales_fact sf
INNER JOIN date_id d
ON sf.date_id = d.date_id)
WHERE d_rnk >= 2 and yyyy = 2023;

corrected query

select month from (select to_char(date,'mmmm') as month ,dense_rank()over( order by total_sales desc) as rnk 
from sales_fact sf
INNER JOIN date_id d
ON sf.date_id = d.date_id
where year =2023
group by to_char(date,'mmmm'))where rnk<=2


2)List the product name, year, total qty sold. I should see only one record per product in each year.

SELECT DISTINCT(prod_name,yyyy), (tot_qty * total_cost) as total_qty_sold
FROM sales_fact sf
INNER JOIN date_id d
ON sf.date_id = d.date_id
INNER JOIN prod_sur_id ps
ON sf.prod_sur_id = ps.prod_sur_id


corrected query:

select prod_name ,year,sum(tot_qty * total_cost) as total_qty_sold
from FROM sales_fact sf
INNER JOIN date_id d
ON sf.date_id = d.date_id
INNER JOIN prod_sur_id ps
ON sf.prod_sur_id = ps.prod_sur_id
group by product_name,year
order by year
